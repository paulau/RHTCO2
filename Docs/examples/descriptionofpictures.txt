Shows the timeseries of temperature, CO2 and relative humidity for one day.
The ventilation is configured to switch ventilator on at 
CO2Limit = 1400 
and to switch it off at
CO2LimitOff = 800 

The frequency of Takted switches depends on the natural airexchange. (Lüftwechselrate)
The more airexchange is there the less is the ventilator needed. 
If the natural air exchange is small, then ventilator is needed oft.
